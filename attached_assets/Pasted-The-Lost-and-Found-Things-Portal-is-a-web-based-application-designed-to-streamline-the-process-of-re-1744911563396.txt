The Lost and Found Things Portal is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of reporting and retrieving lost and found items. This platform aims to bridge the gap between individuals who lose personal belongings and those who find unclaimed items, providing a centralized and user-friendly interface for both parties.

Built using Flask (Python) as the backend framework, integrated with MySQL for data storage, and enhanced with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an interactive frontend, the portal supports functionalities such as user registration and login, posting lost or found items, advanced search with filters, and image uploads. Key features include location-based item discovery using Google Maps integration, admin verification to ensure data authenticity, and email/SMS notifications to alert users about claim updates or matches. The portal also includes two-factor authentication (2FA) for improved security and enhanced user profiles with contact details and profile pictures.

The system is designed with a clear motto—SAI: Secure, Assist, Inform—representing its core values: securing lost items, assisting finders, and informing rightful owners. With an intuitive interface and robust backend, this solution is ideal for use in public spaces like schools, colleges, transport hubs, and workplaces to minimize the inconvenience caused by lost belongings and foster a responsible community.
